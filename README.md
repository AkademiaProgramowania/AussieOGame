# AussieOGame
The backend of a clone of the OGame. Instead of humans in space, there are platypuses in Australia.

# Important before running app
1. Before running go to application.yml and set URL, username and password needed for the SQl database connection or set enviroment variables

# Plans for future
1. Make a more complicated resource system and expand trade between players. Colonies would have, for example,
   1-2 basic resources that are always available and allow for basic development, in addition there would be
   X special resources (2-3 per town) and players could specialize in a specific resource and trade with others.
2. Leaderboard of all players constantly updated in real time
3. Converting enum Race to entity. The player could choose the race that suits him. Each of these races would have
   their pros and cons, meaning that the choice of race would depend on the player's preference and gameplay style.
4. Converting enum Region (formerly Climate) to entity. Each region would have its own characteristics.
   Different races would have bonuses for different regions.
